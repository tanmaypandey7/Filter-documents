      "  Home Elections Breaking: House GOP declares war on the FBI Breaking: House GOP declares war on the FBI 1/29/18 7:28pm by John Aravosis 8 Tweet Tweet Democratic Rep Adam Schiff just announced that the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have opened an investigation of the FBI and the Department of Justice in order to undermine Mueller’s investigation of Trump’s collusion with Russia. The GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee refused to let the FBI come to brief them on why the “Nunes Memo” is wrong, and why it would be dangerous to national security to make it public. The request to brief them came directly from the director of the FBI, a Trump appointee. The GOP said “no.” You’ll recall that the Nunes memo was written by House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes, who has lied in the past to defend Donald Trump and undercut the Mueller investigation. The memo claims that the DOJ and FBI have become cronies for Hillary Clinton, and have an anti-Trump bias. Which is ironic, since the FBI helped get Trump elected, and is a notoriously conservative institution. The memo claims that the DOJ and FBI corruptly investigated Trump-Russia, which is absurd. The Republicans today voted to make public their partisan memo attacking the FBI & DOJ, but refused to make public the Democratic memo defending the FBI & DOJ. The Republican party crossed a line today. We’re in banana republic territory now. Watergate territory. And it involves not just Trump, but the entire Republican congress. We now have a full blown crisis, and I fear what comes next. Trump and the GOP Congress forced the resignation of the #2 in the FBI today (you can hear our latest podcast about that here). And the Nunes Memo attempts to force the resignation of the #2 at the DOJ. We are witnessing a full blown Saturday Night Massacre started by Donald Trump and enabled by the GOP Congress. And no one in the Trump administration or the leadership of the GOP Congress cares about what Russia did to undermine our election, or continues to do to undermine our democracy. This is outrageous, un-American and treasonous behavior by the Republican party. There is literally NO ONE in the Trump administration coordinating the response to Russia’s ongoing attempts to undermine our democracy. NO ONE. Trump is doing NOTHING to stop the Russians from attacking us. When will say “enough” And now the House Intelligence Committee is actively trying to kill the Mueller probe while starting a new investigation accusing the FBI and Dept of Justice of being a criminal hotbed because the FBI & DOJ are the only way we’re going to stop Russia. Who needs Vladimir Putin when you have Donald Trump, Devin Nunes, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell undercutting our democracy and our democratic institutions, from law enforcement to the media, to protect Trump & Russia. Never has our country seen such un-American traitors. Paul Ryan did this. Along with Trump, Nunes & McConnell. Ryan just today said that he agreed with Nunes about the false, defamatory anti-FBI memo meant to undercut the Mueller probe. Let’s make Ryan pay. Donate to Ryan’s 2018 election opponent Randy Bryce here. The only way to stop these people, short of revolution, is at the ballot box this November. We have to DESTROY the GOP in the Fall elections. And let’s start with Paul Ryan, who may actually be in danger of losing his seat. Donate now to Democrat Randy Bryce and ask your friends to do the same.
